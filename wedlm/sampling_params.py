class SamplingParams:
    """Sampling parameters for text generation.
    
    Attributes:
        temperature: Sampling temperature. 0 means greedy decoding.
        top_p: Nucleus sampling parameter. Only tokens with cumulative
            probability <= top_p are considered. 1.0 means no filtering.
        top_k: Top-k sampling parameter. Only the top k tokens are considered.
            0 means no filtering.
        max_tokens: Maximum number of tokens to generate.
        stop_token_ids: List of token IDs that trigger generation stop.
        stop: String or list of strings that trigger generation stop.
        wedlm_entropy_threshold: Entropy threshold for WeDLM parallel decoding.
            If None, selects the position with minimum adjusted entropy.
            If set, all positions with adjusted entropy below this threshold
            will be decoded in parallel.
        wedlm_pos_penalty_factor: Position penalty factor for WeDLM decoding.
            Higher values penalize positions further from the current position,
            making the model prefer to decode earlier positions first.
